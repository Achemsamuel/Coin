## Challenges 
- **Loading SVG in Swift:**
  
- This was solved by utilizing the powerful Swift WKWebViw to load the SVG.
- Firstly, the SVG is downloaded using the URLSessionDataTask and then the data is conveted into a String(data: svgData, encoding: .utf8).
- This string is then loaded inside a <div>svgString<\div> and loaded into the WKWebView.
